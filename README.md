TACOM - Hackathon @ <Academia de Código_>
DEC 2022

// Project Description

Our group created the winning project that took part in the last week at <Academia de Código_> #76 Bootcamp @ OPorto.
We were challenged during the Hackathon to create an app based on the song which was given to us (Take on Me by A-Ha) while applying the technologies we had learned in the previous weeks and using our own creativity. It was an intense 24 hour experience yet it was very rewarding!

// The Idea

We chose to create a website to help children that live in poverty to have a happier Christmas. For that we would post on the website those children's Christmas Letters (with the help of various institutions) and others would be able to buy one or more gifts for them.

// Development

We decided to begin with the website skeleton and logic, separating responsibilities between the group.
While I was responsible for the FrontEnd of the project, we began with the creation of a solid database and API. We then implemented other methods, both FrontEnd and BackEnd, learnt at <Academia de Código_>. We focused on Take on Me videoclip with sketch like images to create our website and make the whole project visually appealing for the user.

// Technologies

Java, OOP, IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Photoshop, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, among others.
